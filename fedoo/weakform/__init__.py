"""WeakForm module.

=============================================
Weak Formulation (:mod:`fedoo.weakform`)
=============================================

In fedoo, the differential equations related to the problem to solve are written
using weak formulations. The weak formations are defined in the WeakForm objects.

  * The WeakForm object include the differential operators (with virtual fields) and can be automatically updated at each time step
    for non linear weak formulations.

  * When created, a WeakForm object doesn't in general know the domain of integration.
    The domain of integration is defined using a :py:class:`Mesh <fedoo.Mesh>`, and is only introduced when creating the corresponding :py:class:`Assembly <fedoo.Assembly>`.

The weakform library of Fedoo includes a few classical weak formulations. Each weak formulation is a class
deriving from the WeakForm class. The developpement
of new weak formulation is easy by copying and modifying an existing class.

The WeakForm library contains the following classes:
